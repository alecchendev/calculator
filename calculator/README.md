# calculator

A simple repl calculator. Inspired by the windows calculator that's 50,000 lines, I wondered
how simple I could make something that does very similar things. I would've actually made
this a graphical application, but I'm a C noob and don't want to deal with the build
system.

This is also a miniature version of some broader compiler techniques, to learn C better.

To do:
- [ ] Parse tokens properly
- [ ] Recursively handle any arithmetic expression
- [ ] Write tests
- [ ] Handle other operations (pow/sqrt, parentheses, log)
- [ ] Parse scientific notation
- [ ] Handle units and conversions
- [ ] Allow running a single command instead of a repl
- [ ] Handle arrow keys (history, moving left/right)
- [ ] Handle other text editing (e.g. option/command + backspace)
